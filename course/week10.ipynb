        "# Week 10: Inheritance and Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lesson:** Inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, multiple inheritance, and super()\n",
        "\n",
        "### Activity Ideas:\n",
        "1. Create a simple Dungeons & Dragons character class hierarchy using inheritance, starting with a base class like `Character` and extending to more specific subclasses like `Wizard`, `Rogue`, and `Warrior`.\n",
        "2. Implement a polymorphic method for each class in the Dungeons & Dragons character hierarchy to describe their special abilities, overriding the method in the subclasses to show their unique skills.\n",
        "3. Using Super Smash Bros. as inspiration, create a base class `Fighter` and extend it to some specific fighter classes like `Mario`, `Link`, and `Samus`. Practice using the super() function to call the base class's methods.\n",
        "4. Design a simple turn-based combat system involving two Dungeons & Dragons characters, where each character is an instance of a subclass from activity 1. Use polymorphism to determine each character's actions based on its class.\n",
        "5. Create a puzzle game involving a maze, where the player can choose a character from the Dungeons & Dragons hierarchy created in activity 1. Each character subclass has unique abilities that can help or hinder their traversal of the maze, demonstrating polymorphism in action.\n",

        "In this activity, you will create a simple Dungeons & Dragons character class hierarchy using inheritance. Start with a base class called `Character` and extend it to more specific subclasses like `Wizard`, `Rogue`, and `Warrior`. Each subclass can have unique attributes and methods that reflect their specific character class.\n",
