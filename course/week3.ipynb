        "# Week 3: Conditional Statements and Loops\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lesson:** Comparison operators, if-elif-else statements, basic loops (for and while)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Activity Ideas:\n",
        "1. Create a simple character selection code in a Dungeons & Dragons-themed text-based game. Players can choose between three basic classes, using input() and a conditional statement to fine-tune their choice.\n",
        "2. Design a basic text-based game where the player can input simple commands like \"move left\" or \"move right.\" Use if-elif-else statements to respond to the commands and create a basic loop to keep the game going until the player types \"quit.\"\n",
        "3. Organize a Super Smash Bros. character tournament bracket by creating a list of characters. Use a for loop to print out a numbered list of all the characters in the bracket and a while loop to simulate matches and update the bracket accordingly.\n",
        "4. Create a basic gamer-themed quiz where players can answer questions about various games (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons, Super Smash Bros., etc.). Use if-elif-else statements to check answers and a loop to repeat the quiz until the player decides to quit.\n",
        "5. Develop a simple text-based guessing game where the player must guess a specific video game character. Use comparison operators and if-elif-else statements to provide hints, and implement a while loop for multiple guesses until the correct character is identified.\n",
