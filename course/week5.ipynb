        "### Activity Ideas:\n",
        "1. Create a simple \"Choose Your Adventure\" game, allowing the user to make different choices using functions for each choice.\n",
        "2. Build a Super Smash Bros. themed character selector, using functions to return a random character and their signature move.\n",
        "3. Create a Dungeons & Dragons character stat roller, using functions to roll dice, generate ability scores, and choose a race/class.\n",
        "4. Design a simple text-based combat game, using different functions for player actions (attack, defend, run). Incorporate Dungeons & Dragons-inspired elements.\n",
        "5. Create a mini trivia game about video games, using functions for questions, answers, and keeping score. Include questions about Super Smash Bros. and Dungeons & Dragons.\n",
