        "1. Create a simple Dungeon Master's dictionary with keys for character names and values for stats. Learn to add, modify, and remove characters.\n",
        "2. Use a set to keep track of unique items found in a treasure chest in a D&D game, eliminating duplicates.\n",
        "3. Create a Super Smash Bros. themed dictionary, where keys are character names and values are their special moves. Practice iterating through the dictionary to display each character's moves.\n",
        "4. Use a set to store unique gamer tags or usernames for an online game. Learn to add and remove players from the set and check membership.\n",
        "5. Create a simple turn-based battle system using dictionaries to store character stats, with keys such as name, health, and attack damage. Run a loop to simulate a battle using these stats.\n",
