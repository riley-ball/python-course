        "\n",
        "**Lesson:** Reading and writing files, file modes, working with paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Activity Ideas:\n",
        "1. Create a simple text-based Dungeon Master's Toolkit that allows the user to save and load their campaign notes to a text file. Practice using file modes and handling paths.\n",
        "2. Write a Super Smash Bros. Character Randomizer that reads a list of characters from a text file and selects a random character for each player. Practice reading files and manipulating data.\n",
        "3. Design a simple \"Choose Your Adventure\" game with a gamer theme, and store each choice and outcome in a separate text file. Practice reading and writing files based on user choices.\n",
        "4. Build a Gamer Quiz that reads questions and answers from a text file and allows users to answer the questions. Keep track of the score and store it in a separate file.\n",
        "5. Create a basic character creation tool for a tabletop RPG like Dungeons & Dragons, and export the generated character stats to a formatted text file. Practice file writing and organization.\n",
