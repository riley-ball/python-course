        "**Lesson:** Understanding different types of errors, exception handling (try, except, else, finally)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Activity Ideas:\n",
        "1. Create a simple Dungeons & Dragons health deduction program, handling errors in case a non-numeric input for health is entered.\n",
        "2. Make a simple text-based Super Smash Bros. attack damage calculator and use exception handling to deal with unexpected inputs.\n",
        "3. Program a \"Guess-the-number\" game limited to three tries, use exception handling to handle wrong input types and display a proper error message.\n",
        "4. Create a gamer-themed quiz and implement error handling to handle if a user inputs an option outside of the given choices.\n",
        "5. Use exception handling to create a basic character attribute assignment program for a role-playing game that does not allow negative attribute points.\n",

        "In this activity, you will create a simple Dungeons & Dragons health deduction program. You will handle errors in case a non-numeric input for health is entered, ensuring the program does not crash.\n",
