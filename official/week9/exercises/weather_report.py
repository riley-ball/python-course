# Objective: Create a function that generates a weather report based on temperature and humidity.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Define a function named 'weather_report' that takes temperature and humidity as arguments.
# 2. The function should return a basic description of the weather (e.g., 'warm', 'cold', 'humid', 'dry') based on the inputs.
# 3. Use default arguments for humidity.

# Notes:
# - For simplicity, consider temperature above 20 as 'warm', below 20 as 'cold', humidity above 50% as 'humid', and below as 'dry'.

# Example Output:
# description = weather_report(25, 60)
# print(description)
# Output: "It's warm and humid today."
