# Objective: Write a function that accepts a string and counts the number of upper and lower case letters.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Define a function named 'count_case' that takes a string as an argument.
# 2. The function should count the number of upper case and lower case letters in the string.
# 3. Return both counts as a tuple.

# Notes:
# - Consider using string methods like isupper() and islower().

# Sample String: 'The quick Brow Fox'
# Example Usage:
# upper_count, lower_count = count_case('The quick Brow Fox')
# print("No. of Upper case characters :", upper_count)
# print("No. of Lower case Characters :", lower_count)
# Expected Output:
# No. of Upper case characters : 3
# No. of Lower case Characters : 12
