# Objective: Create a function that performs simple math operations on two numbers and returns multiple results.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Define a function named 'simple_math' that takes two numbers as arguments.
# 2. The function should return the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of the two numbers.
# 3. Ensure that the division handles division by zero gracefully.

# Notes:
# - Use basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Example Output:
# add, subtract, multiply, divide = simple_math(10, 5)
# print("Addition:", add, "Subtraction:", subtract, "Multiplication:", multiply, "Division:", divide)
# Output: Addition: 15 Subtraction: 5 Multiplication: 50 Division: 2
