### Exercise: Classroom Desk Arrangement

# Objective: Rearrange the seating of students in a classroom by modifying a list of names.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Begin with a list of student names, e.g., ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'].
# 2. Ask the user which student (by index) they want to move and to which position (by index).
# 3. Remove the student from the original position and insert them at the new position.
# 4. Print the updated list of names, showing the new seating arrangement.

# Notes:
# - Be careful when removing and inserting elements to consider how indices change.
# - Ensure that the user's inputs for indices are valid for the list's size.

# Example output:
# Original seating: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David']
# Enter the index of the student to move: 2
# Enter the new position for Charlie: 0
# New seating arrangement: ['Charlie', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'David']
