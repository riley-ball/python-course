### Exercise: Personalize Greeting Cards

# Objective: Customize a list of greeting card messages by replacing a placeholder with a person's name.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Create a list with greeting card messages, each containing the placeholder 'NAME', e.g., 
#    ['Happy Birthday, NAME!', 'Merry Christmas, NAME!', 'Happy New Year, NAME!'].
# 2. Ask the user for their name.
# 3. Ask the user which message (by index) they want to personalize with their name.
# 4. Replace 'NAME' in the message with the user's actual name.
# 5. Print the personalized message.

# Notes:
# - Ensure the user selects a valid index from the list of messages.
# - Use the string replace() method to insert the user's name into the message.

# Example output:
# Available messages: 
# 0. Happy Birthday, NAME!
# 1. Merry Christmas, NAME!
# 2. Happy New Year, NAME!
# What is your name? Emily
# Which message would you like to personalize (0-2)? 1
# Personalized message: Merry Christmas, Emily!
