### Exercise: Virtual Pet Emotions

# Objective: Create a program that mimics a virtual pet's emotions based on user input.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Create a variable to store your virtual pet's happiness level. Initialize it to 5.
# 2. Prompt the user to interact with the virtual pet. They can either "feed", "play", or "scold" the pet.
# 3. Update the happiness level based on the user's action:
#    - "feed": increases happiness by 2
#    - "play": increases happiness by 3
#    - "scold": decreases happiness by 1
# 4. Print the updated happiness level of the pet.
# 5. Provide feedback based on the pet's happiness level. For example, if the happiness is below 3, the pet is sad. 

# Example 1:
# Current happiness level: 5
# What will you do? (feed/play/scold): feed
# New happiness level: 7
# Your pet is happy!

# Example 2:
# Current happiness level: 5
# What will you do? (feed/play/scold): scold
# New happiness level: 4
# Your pet is okay.

# Notes:
# - Ensure to handle invalid inputs appropriately (e.g., if the user inputs something other than "feed", "play", or "scold").
