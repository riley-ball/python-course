### Exercise: Choose Your Own Adventure - Space Edition

# Objective: Create a text-based "Choose Your Own Adventure" game set in outer space, where the user has to make a series of choices.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Tell the user they are an astronaut and have just landed on an alien planet.
# 2. Ask the user if they want to explore to the "left" or "right" of their spaceship.
# 3. Ask the user if they want to take off their helmet. They can answer "yes" or "no".
# 4. Ask the user if they want to pick up a "rock" or "plant" from the planet's surface.
# 5. Determine the outcome based on the following conditions:
#    - If they go to the "left" and take off their helmet, they get into trouble.
#    - If they go to the "right" and pick up a "rock", they discover a rare gem.
#    - If they say "no" to taking off the helmet and go either "left" or "right", they are safe.
#    - Any other combination and they don't find anything interesting.

# Notes:
# - Use 'and' and 'or' conditionals to evaluate the user's choices and provide the appropriate outcome.

# Pre-written Print Statements (Copy and paste these into your conditionals):
# 
# Print this when they get into trouble:
# print("Oh no! You took off your helmet and now you're in trouble with alien space bees!")
#
# Print this when they discover a rare gem:
# print("Congratulations! You found a rare gem on the alien planet!")
#
# Print this when they are safe:
# print("Good job! You made safe choices and returned to your spaceship unharmed.")
#
# Print this when they don't find anything interesting:
# print("Well, that was uneventful. You didn't find anything interesting but at least you're safe.")
