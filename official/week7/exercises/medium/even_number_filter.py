### Exercise 2: Even Number Filter

# Objective: Write a program that filters out and prints only even numbers from a list.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Start with a predefined list of integers, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
# 2. Use a for loop to iterate through the list.
# 3. Inside the loop, check if the current number is even. If so, print it.

# Notes:
# - An even number is divisible by 2.

# Example Output:
# Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
