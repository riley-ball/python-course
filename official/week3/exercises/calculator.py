# TODO: Write your code above this line
# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
# 2. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
# 3. Ask the user to enter an operation (addition '+', subtraction '-', multiplication '*', or division '/').
# 4. Perform the operation based on the user's input.
# 5. Print the result.

# Example 1:
# Enter the first number: 10
# Enter the second number: 5
# Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
# The result is: 15

# Example 2:
# Enter the first number: 9
# Enter the second number: 3
# Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): /
# The result is: 3.0

# Example 3:
# Enter the first number: 7
# Enter the second number: 8
# Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): *
# The result is: 56

# Example 4:
# Enter the first number: 15
# Enter the second number: 0
# Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): /
# Error: Cannot divide by zero.

# Notes:
# - Ensure to handle division by zero appropriately.
# - You may want to convert the input numbers to floats to handle decimal inputs.
# - Ensure to handle invalid operation inputs appropriately.
