# Objective: Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct elements from the first list.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Define a function named 'unique_list' that takes a list as an argument.
# 2. The function should return a new list with only the distinct elements from the original list.

# Notes:
# - Consider using a set to find distinct elements.

# Sample List: [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
# Example Usage:
# print(unique_list([1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]))
# Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
