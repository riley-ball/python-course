# Objective: Write a function to print the even numbers from a given list.

# --------------------------

# Instructions:
# 1. Define a function named 'print_even_numbers' that takes a list of numbers as an argument.
# 2. The function should return a list of all the even numbers from the given list.

# Notes:
# - Use a loop to iterate through the list and check if each number is even.

# Sample List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# Example Usage:
# print(print_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))
# Expected Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
